I traveled to the Yellowstone in June, and stay there about 4 days. For natural sites, Yellowstone is the best national parks in the U.S. as to my own opinion. 
The travel in Yellowstone really gives me a deep impression. The Springs here is really beautiful and unique. As to me, this is the most beautiful Spring in Yellowstone.
Here is the picture for the Grand Prismatic Spring, its color is like a rainbow. It is also highly recommended to take a Overlook of this Spring in the mountain (recommend to drive to the next parking lot ahead and walk to the platform of the mountain, and it will take about 30 minutes, a little bit time consuming but really deserve to have a look of that)
