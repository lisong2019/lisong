I traveled to the Yellowstone in June, and stay there about 4 days. For natural sites, Yellowstone is the best national parks in the U.S. as to my own opinion. 
The travel in Yellowstone really gives me a deep impression. The Springs here is really beautiful and unique. As to me, this is the most beautiful Spring in Yellowstone.
Here is the picture for the Grand Prismatic Spring, its color is like a rainbow. It is also highly recommended to take a Overlook of this Spring in the mountain (recommend to drive to the next parking lot ahead and walk to the platform of the mountain, and it will take about 30 minutes, a little bit time consuming but really deserve to have a look of that)

 We encountered some american bison walking in green grassland and roadways, also for some deers and a cute beer.

 For the whole travel, we first flied from Charlotte to Bozeman, then we drive to the West Yellowstone Village. After that, we went toward sourth and staied in Salt Lake City for one night. Then we staied in Page village and visit the Horseshoe Bend, Grand Canyon, and Arches National Park. 
 We drived to the Grand Canyon and ended our travel in Las Vegas. We also travel to the Hoover Dam and the Death Vally. The scenary in Grand Canyon is also very amazing and really deserve to have a look.
