The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly influenced almost every aspect of daily life, including urban traffic patterns. Thus, it is important to measure the impact of COVID-19 on transportation to further guide agencies and residents to properly respond to changes in traffic patterns. However, most existing traffic performance metrics incorporate only a single traffic parameter and measure only the performance of individual corridors. To overcome these challenges, in this study, a Traffic Performance Score (TPS) is proposed that incorporates multiple parameters for measuring network-wide traffic performance. An interactive web-based TPS platform that provides real-time and historical spatial-temporal traffic performance analysis is developed by the STAR Lab at the University of Washington. Based on data from this platform, this study analyzes the impact of COVID-19 on different road segments and the traffic network as a whole. Considering this pandemic has greatly reshaped social and economic operations, this study also evaluates how COVID-19 is changing the urban mobility from both travel demand and driving behavior perspectives.</div></td>
