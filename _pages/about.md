Li Song (宋力) is currently an Associate Professor in the School of Transportation and Logistics Engineering at the Wuhan University of Technology starting in the Fall of 2022. Dr. Li got his Ph.D. in Transportation from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte in August 2022. Before that, he received an M. S. degree in Transportation Engineering from the Harbin Institute of Technology in 2019 and a B. S. degree in Transportation from Shanghai Maritime University in 2017. <br>

Fueled by Dr. Li's passion and vision for creating intelligent, efficient, and safe transportation systems, Li has dedicated his research to advancing intelligent transportation systems through cutting-edge research. With a strong focus on `intelligent transportation systems`, `crash causation and prevention`, `influence of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs)`, and `transportation big data analysis`, Li has extensive experience utilizing intelligent control strategies, simulation, deep reinforcement learning, machine learning, and statistical approaches to address a range of challenges in this field. Li's ultimate goal is to leverage his knowledge and experience to drive positive change and promote the growth of emerging technologies  that would enhance the efficiency, security, sustainability, and safety of our future transportation systems.<br>
