# RESEARCH INTEREST
-----
## Connected and Autonomous Vehicles: 
Intellegent vehicle technologies; Optimal and control method; Simmulation and impacts analysis. 

## Big Data Analytics & Statistics:
Transportation safety data analysis; Discrete choice modeling; Machine learning and artificial intelligence.<br>
I am also higly interested in the developing data mining technology.

## Future Transportation Systems: 
I am highly interested in technology which could change the furture of the transportation. Including but not limited to: Intellegent tranport control; Sharing mobility; Smart parking; Congestion mitigation.<br>
